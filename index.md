- Feb 9th 2021: [Machine Learning System design](https://rebrand.ly/mlsd_launch) is now available on [educative.io](https://rebrand.ly/mlsd_launch).
- I'm a SWE, ML with 10 years of experience ([Linkedin profile](https://www.linkedin.com/in/phamkhang/)). I had offers from Google, LinkedIn, Coupang, Snap and StichFix. Read my [blog](https://rebrand.ly/mleio). 



- I'm a SWE, ML with 10 years of experiences and I helped people get MLE offers from top companies: FB (E5 and E6), Google (L4), Amazon (L5), Snap (L4, L6), NVIDIA (junior), Coupang (L5), StitchFix (Senior DS) and more. 
- I'm author of [ML interview github repo](https://github.com/khangich/machine-learning-interview) and the ML system design course on [educative.io](https://rebrand.ly/mlsd_launch) and [interviewquery.com](https://rebrand.ly/mlsdmock).

- Learning about ML and modeling is not sufficient to get offers from top companies, you need to stand out from hundreds of other candidates, ML design round is the unique round to achieve that. You can contact me at: helppreparemle@gmail.com and book mock interview [here](https://rebrand.ly/mlsdmock)

# Mock interviews
- I helped people get offers for FB E5/E6, Snap, Amazon, NVIDIA, Google and more. In addition, there are 300+ people took my ML assessments to prepare for their interviews. 


- Why do I offer mock interview?
    - Provide the most relevant and up to date ML techniques and domain knowledge for your targeted teams/companies. 
    - Provide similar ML design interview environment for you to practice your skill. 
    - Provide written feedback after the mock interviews.
    - Provide full life cycle ML design: from training, inference and experimentations.
- Who should NOT take the mock interviews?
    - People still in the early stage: preparation, resume draft, phone screen etc. 
    - People apply for junior roles are usually required for ML design.
    - People apply for Analytics roles.
